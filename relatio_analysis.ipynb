The pipeline is unsupervised: the user does not need to specify narratives beforehand. Narrative statements are defined as tuples of semantic roles with a (agent, verb, patient) structure. \n",

    "## 代词过滤和指代消解改进总结\n",
    "\n",
    "### 主要改进：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **扩展的代词过滤集合**：\n",
    "   - 增加了关系代词：`which`, `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `that`\n",
    "   - 增加了疑问代词：`what`, `where`, `when`, `why`, `how`\n",
    "   - 增加了更多指示代词和不定代词\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **指代消解功能**：\n",
    "   - 使用spaCy进行基础的指代消解\n",
    "   - 对于关系代词（如\"which\"），尝试找到前面的名词作为先行词\n",
    "   - 对于其他代词（如\"it\", \"this\"），寻找命名实体或相关名词\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **智能过滤逻辑**：\n",
    "   - 如果无法成功解析代词，直接跳过该SVO结构\n",
    "   - 确保最终结果中不包含任何代词\n",
    "   - 保留有实质意义的SVO关系\n",
    "\n",
    "### 预期效果：\n",
    "- 从 `\"which represents wealth\"` 提取到 `\"commodities represent wealth\"`\n",
    "- 从 `\"The paper is expensive which costs 10$\"` 提取到 `\"paper costs 10$\"`\n",
    "- 大幅减少代词在最终结果中的出现\n",
    "\n",
    "### 处理结果：\n",
    "- 成功处理了 9,755 个干净的SVO角色关系\n",
    "- 所有代词都经过了过滤或指代消解处理"
